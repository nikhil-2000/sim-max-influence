Define a live-edge model from a linear threshold model
Define a live-edge model from a Independent Cascade Model

Run the live-edge model

Show how well 4 algorithms perform as the number of edges increase
-> Suspect when the graph is sparse, the high degree algorithm perform
    as well as the greedy and CELF
-> As graph edge density increases, the greedy algorithm starts to outperform


Greedy Alg:
    Pick nodes that lead to greatest marginal increase

CELF:

Random:

High Degree:
